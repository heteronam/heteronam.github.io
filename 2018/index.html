                      Graphs naturally represent a host of processes, including interactions between people on social or communication networks, links between webpages on the World Wide Web, protein interactions in biological networks, movement in transportation networks, electricity delivery in smart energy grids, relations in bibliographic data, and many others. In such scenarios, graphs that model real-world networks are typically heterogeneous, multi-modal, and multi-relational.
                      In the era of big data, as more varieties of interconnected structured and semi-structured data are becoming available, the importance of leveraging this heterogeneous and multi-relational nature of networks in being able to effectively mine and learn this kind of data is becoming more evident.
                      The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers from a variety of related areas, and discuss commonalities and differences in challenges faced, survey some of the different approaches, and provide a forum to present and learn about some of the most cutting-edge research in this area. As an outcome, we expect participants to walk away with a better sense of the variety of different methods and tools available for heterogenous network mining and analysis, and an appreciation for some of the interesting emerging applications, as well as the challenges that accompany these applications
                      <br/>
                      There are many challenges involved in effectively mining and learning from this kind of data, including:

                      Traditionally, a number of subareas have contributed to this space: communities in graph mining, learning from structured data, statistical relational learning, and, moving beyond subdisciplines in computer science, social network analysis, and, more broadly network science.

                    <p class="large" style="text-align: justify;">
                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                      Graph mining is a large research area with various fundamental problems, such as importance ranking, clustering and partitioning, relational classification, link prediction, influence and propagation, etc. When rich data is represented as a graph, in which nodes and/or edges may exhibit different types or properties, how do we think about these fundamental problems? In this talk, I will introduce example work from our group on the ranking, classification, and anomaly mining problems for heterogeneous graphs, motivated by applications from a number of different fields.

                    <p class="large" style="text-align: justify;">
                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                      In real-world applications, objects of multiple types are interconnected, forming Heterogeneous Information Networks. In such heterogeneous information networks, we make a key observation that many interactions happen due to some event and the objects in each event form a complete semantic unit. By taking advantage of such a property, we propose a generic framework called Hyper Edge-Based Embedding (HEBE) to learn object embeddings with events in heterogeneous information networks, where a hyperedge encompasses the objects participating in one event. The HEBE framework models the proximity among objects in each event with two methods: (1) predicting a target object given other participating objects in the event, and (2) predicting if the event can be observed given all the participating objects. Since each hyperedge encapsulates more information of a given event, HEBE is robust to data sparseness and noise. In addition, HEBE is scalable when the data size spirals. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets show the efficacy and robustness of the proposed framework.

                    <h4>The Paradoxes of Social Data</h4>
                    <p class="large" style="text-align: justify;">
                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                      Macro and micro views of social data are often incompatible. In this talk, I will discuss two paradoxes arising from this discrepancy and show how they can bias analysis of social data. First, I discuss Simpson’s paradox, which occurs when an association observed in the data at the macro (population) level disappears or even reverses when data is disaggregated on a micro level (into its underlying subgroups). I illustrate with several examples showing how the paradox can distort conclusions of a study, and describe recent algorithmic efforts to address this problem. Second, I discuss the counter-intuitive effects in social network that may significantly distort the observations people make of their friends. These effects include the “strong friendship paradox,” which states that most of your friends have more friends than you do, and its generalizations. As a result of these paradoxes, an opinion that is macroscopically (globally) rare may be dramatically over-represented in the micro (local) neighborhoods of many individuals.  This effect, which I call the ``majority illusion,'' leads individuals to systematically overestimate the prevalence of a minority opinion, and may accelerate the spread of social contagions and adoption of social norms.

                    <p class="large" style="text-align: justify;">
                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                      Predictive models of human behavior--and in particular recommender systems--learn patterns from large volumes of historical activity data, in order to make personalized predictions that adapt to the needs, nuances, and preferences of individuals. Models may take incredibly complex data as *input*, ranging from text, images, social networks, or sequence data. However, the *outputs* they are trained to predict--clicks, purchases, transactions, etc.--are typically simple, numerical quantities, in order for the problem to be cast in terms of traditional supervised learning frameworks.
                      In this talk, we discuss possible extensions to such personalized, predictive models of human behavior so that they are capable of predicting complex structured *outputs*. For example, rather than training a model to predict what content a user might interact with, we could predict how they would react to unseen content, in the form of text they might write. Or, rather than predicting whether a user would purchase an existing product, we could predict the characteristics or attributes of the types of products that *should* be created.

                    <p class="large" style="text-align: justify;">
                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                      Network modeling and measuring are two fundamental tasks for social network analysis. The majority of existing efforts have focused on unsigned networks (or networks with only positive links). However, in many real-world social systems, relations between two nodes can be represented as signed networks with positive and negative links, where negative links can denote their foes, distrust, or "unfriended" friends and blocked users. It is evident that the key properties and principles in signed networks are distinct from those of unsigned networks. Hence, dedicated efforts are desired for signed networks. In this talk, we will discuss our recent work on signed generative network models and signed node relevance measurements. Both works suggest great opportunities in this new research subfield.

                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The task of community detection  over complex networks is of paramount importance in a multitude of applications. The present work puts forward a top-to-bottom community identification approach, termed DC-EgoTen, in which an egonet-tensor (EgoTen) based algorithm is developed in a divide-and-conquer (DC) fashion for breaking the network into smaller subgraphs, out of which the underlying communities progressively emerge. In particular, each step of DC-EgoTen forms a multi-dimensional egonet-based representation of the graph, whose  induced structure enables casting  the task of overlapping community identification as a constrained PARAFAC decomposition. Thanks to the higher representational capacity of tensors, the novel egonet-based representation improves the quality of detected communities by capturing multi-hop connectivity patterns of the network. In addition, the top-to-bottom approach ensures successive refinement of identified communities, so that the desired resolution is achieved. Synthetic as well as real-world tests corroborate the effectiveness of DC-EgoTen.

                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Community detection in real-world graphs has been shown to benefit from using multi-aspect information, e.g., in the form of “means of communication” between nodes in the network. An orthogonal line of work, broadly construed as semi-supervised learning, approaches the problem by introducing a small percentage of node assignments to communities and propagates that knowledge throughout the graph. In this paper, we introduce SMACD, a novel semi-supervised multi-aspect community detection. To the best of our knowledge, SMACD is the first approach to incorporate multi-aspect graph information and semi-supervision, while being able to discover communities.We extensively evaluate SMACD’s performance in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches across six real and two synthetic datasets and demonstrate that SMACD, through combining semi-supervision and multi-aspect edge information, outperforms the baselines.

                  <strong>Abstract:</strong>     Network alignment (NA) aims to find a node mapping between the compared networks that uncovers regions of high similarity. Existing NA methods are homogeneous; that is, they deal with networks containing nodes and edges of one type. These methods compute node similarities and find high scoring alignments with respect to these similarities, while simultaneously maximizing the number of conserved edges. However, due to the increasing amount of network data with nodes and edges of different types, we generalize three recent state-of-the-art homogeneous NA methods, WAVE, MAGNA++, and SANA, to enable heterogeneous NA for the first time. We introduce two novelties to do this. First, we generalize homogeneous graphlets, which have been proven as a measure of node similarity, to their heterogeneous counterparts. Second, we generalize $S^3$, a homogeneous measure of edge conservation that has been proven in homogeneous NA, to its heterogeneous counterpart. In evaluations on synthetic networks and real-world biological data, using these optimizations for heterogeneous NA lead to better alignments and better robustness to noise in the data than their homogeneous counterparts.

                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> In recent years, the rapid growth in technology has increased the opportunity for longitudinal human behavioral studies. Rich multimodal data, from wearables like Fitbit, online social networks, mobile phones etc. can be collected in natural environments. Uncovering the underlying low-dimensional structure of noisy multi-dimensional data in an unsupervised setting is a challenging problem. Tensor factorization has been  successful in extracting the interconnected low dimensional descriptions of multi-dimensional data. In this paper, we apply non-negative tensor factorization on a real-word wearable sensor data, StudentLife, to find latent temporal factors and group of individuals. Meta data is available for the semester schedule, as well as  the individuals' performance and personality. We demonstrate that non-negative tensor factorization can successfully discover clusters of individuals who exhibit higher academic performance, as well as those who frequently engage in leisure activities. The recovered latent temporal patterns associated with these groups are validated against ground truth data to demonstrate the accuracy of our framework.

                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Events such as shootings, protests, flight crashes and new public policies are broadcasted across news media and social media in our society. Different media sources cover different facets of the events. In this work, we extend the idea of heterogeneous information network to formulate and study "cross-media information network''. We propose a multifaceted analysis framework that models four critical facets to fully understand the events across social media network and news media network. The facets include media type for differentiating event information sources; content for discovering events from unstructured text; sentiment for quantifying user reflection on events; and, time for turning events into dynamic evolving objects. We evaluate our framework on a real-world cross-media network based on Twitter and Google News. Experiments demonstrate our framework can generate interesting and useful event description and visualization for human inspection.

                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Geographic information retrieval (GIR) research mainly focuses on finding relevant geographic artifacts along one layer, although answers to queries should preferably include artifacts across multiple layers. This paper addresses this limitation, by exploiting relationships that exist between geographical objects of the same or different types.  Given the existence of these relationships we can infer additional indirect semantic relationships between geographical objects that otherwise would be ignored. This semantic information contains multiple dimensions.  This research creates a mathematical model of semantically relevant geographic objects that belong to different layers using the construct of multiplex networks.  The proposed model respects and extends the “layered” structure of geographic data, and enhances the results of queries made to a GIS. A prototype system has been implemented over an existing GIS relational database. Experiments with the prototype show significant improvements in the results of queries, measured using precision and recall.

                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> A widely studied non-deterministic polynomial time (NP) hard problem lies in finding a route between the two nodes of a graph. Often meta-heuristics algorithms such as $A^{*}$ are employed on graphs with a large number of nodes. Here, we propose a deep recurrent neural network architecture based on the Sequence-2-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model, widely used, for instance in text translation. Particularly, we illustrate that utilising a context vector that has been learned from two different recurrent networks enables increased accuracies in learning the shortest route of a graph. Additionally, we show that one can boost the performance of the Seq2Seq network by smoothing the loss function using a homotopy continuation of the decoder's loss function.

                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Link prediction is an important task in complex networks which has a wide variety of applications in recommendation systems. Although many community detection methods can be used in this end, the recently proved No Free Lunch theorem for community detection implies that each makes some kind of trade-off, and no algorithm can be optimal on all inputs. Different algorithms will thus over- or under-fit on different inputs, finding more, fewer, or just different communities than is optimal. Therefore, algorithms vary widely in how many communities they find in a given input, and these differences induce wide variation in accuracy on link prediction task. On the other hand, stacked generalization approach helps to design a high-level classification model via combining the lower-level models. The goal is to have better predictive performance by learning and fusing the best performance of each link prediction algorithm in different feature configurations. In this paper, we present a novel ensemble approach on link prediction using stacked generalization and show that via this approach we can achieve a higher precision and recall compared to each algorithm and to the best-overall-predictors. We present our results on 11 edge prediction algorithms on a novel and diverse corpus of 406 diverse real-world networks.

                    Authors should clearly indicate in their abstracts the kinds of submissions that the papers belong to, to help reviewers better understand their contributions. <br/>
                    Submissions must be in PDF, <strong>no more than 8 pages long</strong> — shorter papers are welcome — and formatted according to the standard double-column <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template#aL2" target=_blank>ACM Proceedings Style</a>. <br/>
                    The accepted papers will be published on the workshop’s website and will not be considered archival for resubmission purposes. <br/>
                    Authors whose papers are accepted to the workshop will have the opportunity to participate in a spotlight and poster session, and some set may also be chosen for oral presentation. 

                    For paper submission, please proceed to the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=heteronam2018" target=_blank>submission website</a>.<br/><br/>

                    <strong>Please send enquiries to chair@heteronam.org</strong></br></br>
